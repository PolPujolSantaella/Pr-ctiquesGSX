Instructions for creating a bootable MemTest86 USB drive.
=========================================================

1) Insert a USB drive into a USB slot.
2) Determine which device the USB drive is assigned as (eg. /dev/sdc [Linux] or /dev/disk2 [Mac]).
3) As root type: dd if=memtest86-<ver>.usb.img of=<dev>

where dev is the device the key is assigned to. Use the base device (eg. /dev/sdc [Linux] or /dev/disk2 [Mac]) 
not a partition designation (eg. /dev/sdc1 or /dev/disk2s1).

Warning: all data on the USB key will be lost. 
Warning Warning: Make sure that the device used in the dd command above
is correct!!!
